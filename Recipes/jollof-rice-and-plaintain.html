    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This traditional Nigerian dish brings out the best possible flavor of rice
      and chicken. Chicken is first sauteed on the stove top to produce a
      wonderful aromatic base for the rice. For an extra special and authentic
      touch, serve jollof rice with fried plantains.

      <li>3 cups parboiled rice (such as Uncle Ben's®)</li>
      <li>
        1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, corn, peas)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Plantains:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 ripe plantains, peeled and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices</li>
      <li>½ cup canola oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 1/2
        onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1 teaspoon
        herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well. Cook
        until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. Pour in
        water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15
        minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking
        liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard
        solids.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle
        and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and
        cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5
        minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and
        infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de
        Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice.
        Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add
        frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add
        plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3
        minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend
        plantains and serve with chicken.
